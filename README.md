# MyStore project 

This project is a mockup webapp developed with Spring, Hibernate and Angular. 

Users are able to log into the app and from within, it is possible to create, purchase and delete products. Beside storing new products in the database and prompting them in the frontend, the transaction of each purchase is available for the user who owns the sold item.

Feel free to have a look around and let me know if you have any question!
